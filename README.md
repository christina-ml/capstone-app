### Encrypt our passwords (Backend)
Using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt): A library to help you hash passwords.
```
npm install bcrypt
```
Go to users route, set variable
`const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');`

Go to POST route

### JSON Web Tokens
An implementation of [JSON Web Tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).
This was developed against `draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-08`. It makes use of [node-jws](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jws)

What is a JWT? [https://supertokens.com/blog/what-is-jwt](https://supertokens.com/blog/what-is-jwt)
Three parts: Header, Payload, Signature

Install [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)
```
npm install jsonwebtoken
```

make utils folder
file: `jwt-helpers.js`
create tokens, for example (not full code - see file):
```
const accessToken = jwt.sign(user, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, {expiresIn: '30d'});
const refreshToken = jwt.sign(user, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, {expiresIn: '30d'});
```
add to `.env` file - values can be anything
```
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=randomTextHere
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=somethingElseHere
```
(if not done already) install dotenv
```
npm install dotenv
```

set up tokens with `jwt-helpers.js` file - helper function
and send data

What is "salt" [heynode.com](https://heynode.com/blog/2020-04/salt-and-hash-passwords-bcrypt/#:~:text=A%20salt%20is%20a%20random%20string%20that%20makes%20the%20hash,storing%20it%20in%20a%20database.)
Before hashing a password, we apply a salt. A salt is a random string that makes the hash unpredictable.

Bcrypt is a popular and trusted method for salt and hashing passwords. You have learned how to use bcrypt's NodeJS library to salt and hash a password before storing it in a database. You have also learned how to use the bcrypt compare function to compare a password to a hash, which is necessary for authentication.

^^ Christina says:
- Moved query into `usersController` and error is now gone?
- still getting same error on frontend when making a POST request.

As of 1/28/23:
`UserNewForm.js` creates a new user with hashed password, but is not connected to the `LoginModal.js` in any way
`CreateAccountForm.js` doesn't create any user at all for some reason

^^ Issue resolved. The query on the backend had an error. It needed the variables to use the exact spelling as in the schema to work properly since I needed `user_password` instead of `password` for example.

Frontend: Error handling for when creating a new user:
 - username must be unique not null (unique on backend schema as well)
 - email must be unique (unique on backend schema as well)

To Do: Protected routes, to give access to only the user that is logged in.


### Protected routes
A user needs to be logged in to access a particular route
Example: An app has two routes: 
- /videos which is a page that lists videos
- /profile is a page that shows a user's profile when logged in
Example: /videos is a "hidden" route to a page with links to videos
When a user is logged in, show a link for /videos
When a user is logged out, can't see the link to /videos
Example: /profile is a protected route
Can only get to /profile if the user is logged in

Questions to ask:
What do you want to show someone when they're logged in?
What do you not want people to access when they're not logged in?
Example: /profile has user information about a user that you wouldn't want other users to see if they're not logged in
- we want to only fetch that user's information if the user is logged in


# Protected Routes
## AccountsController Route (backend)
Protected Route:
`http://localhost:3333/accounts` this is a route where a user needs to be logged in to access this route

Middleware - `Authorization.js` is middleware that goes into the AccountsController.js route.
```
accounts.get('/', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
  ...// code here
}
```
It verifies the token before letting the user proceed to having access to the route.

// *** You need to be logged in to acccess this route ***
// Example: http://localhost:3333/accounts
// get all accounts of all of our users
// json object has an `accountNumber` and `accountBalance` for each user as an array
// this information is not in our database, want to make sure we can only get it if we are logged in
// middleware - will be in the middle of our route and callback function, call it "authenticateToken"
    // if the token is authenticated, continue with our route

## dark mode using local storage
<!-- https://css-tricks.com/easy-dark-mode-and-multiple-color-themes-in-react/ -->

```
npm i use-local-storage
```
Local storage allows the theme to be stored, so a user can keep seeing the "light" or "dark" mode that was chosen, after page reload.

### Dark Mode colors:
The recommended dark theme surface color by Material Design is: Dark Grey â€” #121212.
[Dark Mode UI Design: A Complete Guide](https://compilezero.medium.com/dark-mode-ui-design-the-definitive-guide-part-1-color-53dcfaea5129#:~:text=Using%20Dark%20Grey&text=The%20recommended%20dark%20theme%20surface,Dark%20Grey%20%E2%80%94%20%23121212.)


# One-to-many relationship (backend)

Models

Each model is represented by a table in the database.
- Users
- Currencies

Relationships

The tables have a one-to-many relationship

- A user has many currencies
- Each currency has a user

# CoinMarketCap API (where I got my data from)

I'm not using the API directly for this project, but instead using it as a starting point, so I can have some actual real-world data to work with.

[CoinMarketCap API Documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Quick-Start-Guide)

## (Sandbox)

testing with sandbox environment (has mock data only):
```
sandbox-api.coinmarketcap.com
```
To get real data, replace sandbox with:
```
https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com
```

1. Preferred method: Via a custom header named `X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY`
2. Convenience method: Via a query string parameter named:
```
CMC_PRO_API_KEY
```

test API Key:
```

# Overview

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
<img src="./frontend/src/assets/erd.png" alt="event-relational-database"/>

# Getting Started

After forking and cloning this project, run these commands on the backend:
```
npm i
```
You will need a `.env` file for the backend (with these fields completed)
```
PORT=
PG_HOST=
PG_PORT=
PG_DATABASE=
PG_USER=
PG_PASSWORD=
```

## Basic commands to run the backend

First, `cd` into the backend directory using the terminal.

To run the backend, you'll find these scripts in the `package.json` file.
Run them **in this order** to initialize the database, seed the database, and then start the backend.

```
npm run db:init
npm run db:seed
npm start
```

Go to your browser, and go to 
`http://localhost:[name of backend port]`

example: `http://localhost:3333/`

# Frontend

After forking and cloning this project, run these commands on the frontend:
```
npm i
```

In a previous version of this app, Material UI was used. It has been removed.

In case there are issues with [Material UI](https://mui.com/), run this command: 
```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

```

This app will now be using CSS and SASS.
[Node-Sass]():
```
npm install node-sass
```

## react-icons
[react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)

```
npm install react-icons --save
```
Example: Mobile layout - collapsible menu icon


## Chart.js
https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2
https://upmostly.com/tutorials/how-to-use-chart-js-with-react
```
npm install chart.js
npm i react-chartjs-2
```

## axios
```
npm install axios
```

## Basic command to run the frontend

First, `cd` into the frontend directory using the terminal.

To run the frontend, you'll find this script in the `package.json` file.

```
npm start
```

This should open up automatically in the browser, but if it doesn't, go to 
`http://localhost:[name of frontend port]`

example: `http://localhost:3000/`


## Material UI

As mentioned eariler, I had removed all Material UI from the first version of this app (with my capstone group), after I forked the project to make it my own. I am adding it back in thoughtfully, to help develop my understanding of what is necessary for each component and factoring in how much time and effort it would take to create these components from scratch to achieve similar results.

[Material UI](https://mui.com/) is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design. It includes a comprehensive collection of prebuilt components that are ready for use in production right out of the box.

I am using Material UI for these components:
 - Login Modal, for modal
 - UserNewForm, for username availability alerts

### Installing Material UI
```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

for Loop icon (`LoginButton` component):
```
npm i @mui/icons-material
```


# Backend Routes
